> It seems to be that Rust does not really offer a lot with regards to HTTP clients
> _as part of the standard library_. That last part is key, don't @ me. There are a few ubiquitous libraries to be found, such as [Hyper](https://crates.io/crates/hyper), [curl-rust](https://crates.io/crates/curl) and [Reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) keep cropping up.
> From the above, Reqwest is the higher level one, which is perfect as I'm not that interested in learning the ins and outs of
> these lower level APIs just yet.
